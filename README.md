# inventory-server
A Home Inventory Manager is a practical and useful project that can help users keep track of their belongings and household items. Here's a breakdown of some key features and implementation strategies for this project:

Features:

User Authentication and Authorization:

Implement user authentication to allow users to create accounts and securely access their inventory data. You can use libraries like Passport.js for authentication and define user roles for different levels of access.
Item Cataloging:

Develop functionality for users to add items to their inventory by providing details such as item name, description, category, purchase date, price, and photos. You can use a database like MongoDB to store item information.
Search and Filter Options:

Implement search and filter options to allow users to quickly find items in their inventory based on criteria such as category, purchase date, or location within the home.
Inventory Organization:

Provide features for users to organize their inventory by grouping items into categories (e.g., electronics, furniture, clothing) and adding tags or labels for easy identification.
Photo Upload and Gallery:

Allow users to upload photos of their items to visually document their inventory. Implement a gallery view where users can browse through item photos and view details.
Barcode Scanning (Optional):

If you want to add an extra feature, you can integrate barcode scanning functionality to allow users to quickly add items to their inventory by scanning barcodes with their mobile devices.
Insurance Documentation:

Enable users to attach insurance documentation, receipts, or warranty information to their inventory items for reference in case of loss or damage.
Data Backup and Export:

Implement regular data backups to prevent data loss and provide users with the option to export their inventory data in a format such as CSV or PDF for offline storage or sharing purposes.
